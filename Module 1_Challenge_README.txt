# Kickstarting with Excel

## Project Overview
Louise's play *Fever* came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Due to these two variables of fundraising goals and time, Louise wants to analyze how other campaigns managed when considering launch dates and funding goals. 

### Purpose
Excel will be used to analyze the Kickstarter dataset and to provide visualizatons for Louise to better help determine her funding goals and launch dates. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
All years (2009-2017) of the theater parent category were considered. Additionally, only fundraisers that were successful, failed, or canceled were considered. This resulted in a grand total of 1369 campaigns. Of the 1369 campaigns, 839 were successful, 493 failed, and 37 were canceled. Canceled fundraisers are relatively low compared to the ones that were successful or failed. On a month-to-month basis, the number of successful and failed fundraisers increased and decreased similarly.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
All years (2009-2017) if the plays subcategory were considered. Additionally, only fundraisers that were succesful, failed, or canceled were considered. The goal range with the highest number of successful fundraisers were $1000-4999. The goal range with the highest number of failed fundraisers were also $1000-4999. There were no fundraisers that were canceled. Goals less than $1000 had the highest percentage of success, followed by goal range of $1000-4999. Generally, the higher the goal, the smaller the percentage of success. However, goal ranges of $35000-39999 and $40000-44999 were tied for third most percentage of success. Similarly, as goal ranges increase, the failed percentage increase. The exception is goal ranges $35000-39999 and $40000-44999 where the fail percentage is both at 33%. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- Conclusions for Outcomes based on Launch Date: On a seasonal basis, Spring and Summer seem to be the best months to launch a fundraiser. The best month to launch a fundraiser is May, followed by June. Fundraisers generally do not get canceled; they either succeed or fail. Since successful and failed fundraisers increase and descrease similarly on a monthly basis, there is probably another variable that causes a fundraiser to succeed or fail. For Louise to have a successful fundraiser, it is recommended to launch in Spring or Summer. Additionally, more research is needed to determine what other variables would cause a fundraiser to succeed or fail.

- Conclusions for Outcomes based on Goals: The smaller the goal, the higher the percentage of success. The greater the goal, the higher the fail percentage. The exception is the goal ranges $35000-39999 and $40000-44999. These two goal ranges do not follow the trend and have a high percentage of success with a low fail percentage. Louise should consider setting a fundraiser goal in the $35000-39999 and $40000-44999 ranges since there is a 67% percent chance of success and 33% chance of failing. 

- Limitations of this dataset: The data for Outcomes based on Launch date seem to be missing a key variable since successful and failed fundraisers increase and descrease similarly on a monthly basis. Whether it is included in the dataset or not, there is a vairable driving the increases and decreases similarly on a monthly basis. It provides a correlation between success and failed fundraisers per month, but does not mean that launching a fundraiser on a certain month will be successful or not. Similarly with the Outcomes Based on Goals data, a variable seem to be missing that could explain why fundraiseres had high percentage of success and low percentage of failure in the goal ranges $35000-39999 and $40000-44999. Again, this conclusion is just correlation. Choosing a fundraiser goal in the goal ranges of $35000-39999 and $40000-44999 will not always result in a successful fundraiser.
- Other possible tables and/or graphs that could be created: Based on Louise's play, she wanted to analyze how the fundraiser goal and launch date could play a role in a successful or failed fundraiser.
